# Salon Booking & Queue Frontend (Firebase-ready)

This is a frontend-only project designed to be hosted on **GitHub Pages** and use **Firebase Firestore** for real-time queue sharing.

## Features
- Join a shared queue (clients)
- View your position & estimated wait time
- Admin dashboard with Serve / Complete / Remove actions
- Works on GitHub Pages (no custom backend required)

## Setup
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Enable **Firestore** in the project.
3. (Optional) Enable **Authentication** if you want a secure admin login.
4. Copy your Firebase config and replace the placeholders in `firebase.js`.
5. Commit and push the files to a GitHub repo. Enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages).
6. Open your site (e.g. https://username.github.io/repo-name/) and test.

## Notes & Security
- This app uses Firestore security rules. For production, configure rules so only trusted admins can perform administrative actions.
- Right now the admin page is unprotected — add Firebase Auth or protect the page on your hosting if needed.

## Files
- `index.html` — home / join queue
- `queue.html` — individual queue status
- `admin.html` — admin dashboard
- `styles.css` — styling
- `main.js` — application logic (Firestore integration)
- `firebase.js` — paste your Firebase config here

## Quick Test (without Firebase)
If you want to demo without Firebase, open `index.html` and the pages will still work but will show a README warning instead of connecting.
